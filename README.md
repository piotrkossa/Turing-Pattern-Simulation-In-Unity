# Turing-Pattern-Simulation-In-Unity

The goal of this project is to implement the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion
model in real time in Unity. It leverages the parallel processing power of
the GPU using Compute Shaders (and Fragment Shaders for web compatibility) to visualize complex Turing patterns at
an efficient refresh rate. For more info check [Project Document](Project-Document.pdf)
